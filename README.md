This repo contains code to build an over-engineered gingerbread house using sensors connected to micro:bit, arduino and raspberry pi.

#Available sensors & gadgets
* Moisture sensor
* Temperature + humidity sensor
* Proximity sensor
* Motion sensor
* Speaker
* Electromagnet
* Servo 
* Compass
* Light sensor
* Noise sensor
* Relay
* Crash sensor
* Submersible pump
* Motor with fan
* Mini light ring (8 LED)
* Larger light ring (24 LED)
* Rotary angle sensor
* Rectangular LCD
* Buzzer
* Large Push button
* Small button

#Over-engineering ideas
* Solar panel on the roof
* Motion sensor around the fireplace
  * Should turn on christmas tree lights
* Fireplace "fire" using red and yellow LED - turn on when certain temperature outside
* LED panel behind house with snow pattern
  * If high enough resolution: Image of sled + reindeers riding through it
* Miniscreen in house to act as TV - christmassy looping pattern
* touchscreen on the outside to act as controller
* LED christmas lights
* Curtains going down when it is light outside
* Indoor camera - streaming to control panel
* Automatic door opener (button controlled?)
* Big push button should start a "christmas protocol" which plays music, lightshow, etc
* Large LED ring could be used to show basic 24 hr clock OR! Countdown to christmas from the 1st of december!
